# Oslo-Model
The complexity project for the Complexity & Network course in Imperial College Physics.  
This implementation seeks to build a physical model and capture the intrinstic properties of the system, which arguably increases the clarity and readability.  

The results are shown [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zraxon/Oslo-Model/blob/master/Oslo%20Model.ipynb).
